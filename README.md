# reimbursements

This is the repo to create a reimbursement request portal to automate some of the organizing and processing that I need to do a treasurer of a college organization.

## goals
have users be able to submit a photo of a receipt along with information filled out for required fields like name of person, how payment should be recieved, contact number. Ideally make some of this dropdown so that user input is consistent.
store receipts and other info in a database, maybe have treasurer view accesible with login so that I can see all this information easily. Could later be a feature that I can upload our payments to others (invoices) and mark reimbursement requests as completed or not.

will use python on backend with free aws database most likely.
